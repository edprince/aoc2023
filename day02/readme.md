Part one was the time-consuming one on this for me. Took me ages to figure out that I was making a really dumb logic error. I was totalling up the number of each colour dice for each round, rather than tracking what the maximum number of dice for each round was.

Part of the time-consuming aspect was the TypeScript setup, and strying to figure out the data structure I could use to solve. Most of the logic was super simple, and the processing was just a lot of splitting. I guess it's not ideal to have a triple nested for loop.

Part 2 was completely trivial with my part one implementation.
